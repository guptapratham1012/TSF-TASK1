    <ol id="para">
    Many people give to charity on a regular basis, because they’d either like to make a difference, have a positive impact on others or just because it makes them feel good about themselves.<br>
    But did you know that there are studies that show, giving to charity carries its own health and wellbeing benefits and it also has positive effects on your personal lives?<br>
    As there are many proven benefits to giving to charity, scientific research and from other individuals experiences, in this article, we will be covering only the five main points.<br><br>
    <li><b> Giving to charity can improve your self-esteem and self-worth</b><br> <br>
    Donating is a selfless act, so giving to charity will improve your self-esteem and self-worth. By donating money to charity, you will achieve a greater sense of satisfaction and growth as it feels good to help others and provide them with all the essential resources.
    The population of Yemen are a great example of people that you could help and provide them with the resources that they need. Saba Relief are a non-profit charity organisation who work very closely with individuals in Yemen who have nowhere to go or anyone to turn to. Individuals who have been displaced, children who are malnourished and families that have had their homes torn down because of the horrible war.<br> <br></li>
    <li> <b> Giving to charity will result in greatly boosting your mood </b><br> <br>
    Alongside a great sense of self-esteem and self-worth, giving to charity will also help lower your depression levels and will positively increase your mood tremendously, due to the psychology of generosity.
    Studies have shown that giving money to charity has a positive impact on the brain, filling you with happiness and a sense of being grateful. These effects are like when you are giving a loved one a hug. Imagine how it would make you feel to help someone, like a malnourished child in Yemen or by feeding a needy family. Keep this in mind next time you are having a bad day and want to make a difference.
    Also, scientifically speaking, the more you give to charity, the happier you will be. In a study conducted by Harbaugh, Mayr and Burghart (2007) neural activity was recorded when participants were given a $100 amount between themselves and a local food bank. The results indicated that whoever gave money to the food bank, experienced activities in the brain similar to receiving pleasure and reward. These results suggest that giving in the act of charity, is inherently rewarding and satisfyingly pleasing.<br> <br></li>
    <li> <b> The impact of giving to charity has on others</b><br><br>
    One person’s charitable donation can positively impact more people’s lives than a giver can ever comprehend. With your donations, charities all around the world are able to provide the needy with things that they may require to get by on a daily basis, like food and clean water.
    In Yemen for example, the people are not so fortunate to own the things that most of us do. They can’t get access to clean water, they are unable to get treated for illnesses like cholera, and helpless parents are unable to feed their starving children.
    You may think that donating might not make a difference, but small steps can eventually make a tremendous change.
    Take this other story of the boy and the starfish.
    ‘Once upon a time, a man walking along a beach saw a boy picking up starfish and throwing them into the sea.
    He asked the boy why he was throwing starfish into the sea.
    The boy replied, “The tide is going out. If I don’t throw them in, they’ll dry up and die.”
    The man smiled patronisingly and said, “But, there are miles of beach and thousands of starfish on every mile. You can’t possibly make a difference!”
    The boy smiled, bent down, picked up another starfish, and threw it into the sea.
    “Well,” he said, “I made a difference for that one.”’
    This story indicates to us, why helping others and giving to charity can be very valuable.
    Therefore, the aid that Saba Relief can do with your donations, can tremendously impact more lives in Yemen than anyone can ever think that it can.
    Saba Relief provide emergency aid to those in need in Yemen, by giving them nutritious food, clean water, medical aid and education to children. With your help, we can help the people of Yemen foster a happier and healthier life.<br> <br></li>
    <li> <b> Sharing the generosity of giving to charity with your children </b> <br><br>
    Being able to share the generosity of giving to charity with your children or loved ones, can really help you teach young people and children, whether they are your own or others around you, and the importance of caring for one and another, which is an important life lesson.
    As we near the blessed month of Ramadan, we need to implement the importance of giving to charity to our children. Explain to them how fortunate they are compared to many children out there, who wish to be in their shoes, who wish to eat a warm, home cooked meal and have clean water to drink.
    This will allow our children to prosper in life and become a lot more appreciative to everything, whether it is small or big. It will also teach them to give rather than to just always receive. When children see you donating money, they are much more likely to adopt a giving mindset as they grow up. Tell them when you have donated money to a great cause, let them be part of the experience.<br> <br></li>
    <li><b>Donating and giving to charity can mean many things </b> <br><br>
    You may not be in a position to donate money, but donations come in many other forms, such as, donating unwanted clothes, footwear or even toys. You could also start by donating your time. For example, you could be volunteering, and even sharing the cause with as many people as you possibly can.
    This way, you will guarantee that you will be meeting new and like-minded people who care about the same great cause, which will increase your knowledge on everyday affairs, and you’ll feel good about giving back to charity.<br> <br></li>
